A medical robot to assist a doctor during a pandemic or regions where medicine is poorly developed and there are no highly qualified personnel, more time is needed to investigate cases of the disease.  The main area of ​​research is easily recognizable human diseases.  The research work will be applied using medical literature, covering the population of the throat and skin of the human body on the Internet using an offline system.
  The purpose of the work: the creation of a medical robot based on several neural networks, which will relieve the medical staff.
  Tasks:
  1) Find an open base for detecting the throat of a person and his skin,
  analyze income data, separate it by health condition, discard low-quality images that can create a machine learning model that can lead to illness.
  2) Create a model of the robot, which will clearly indicate its dimensions,
  design and layout of the main modules.
  3) Based on the database of people, a neural network is created, waiting for the person standing in front of the camera.
  4) Assemble the robot by pre-flashing the microcontroller and connecting the camera and temperature sensor.
  Expected result: A robot created from composite, ecological materials that do not have significant harm to human health, using a large number of cells, will take pictures of the skin and throat of a person and, based on them, make diagnoses, identify their detection for verification,  since the risk of incorrect installation on the patient version is excluded.  With the help of a communication team, he can accept diseases and communicate with them.  Perhaps, during a pandemic, doctors can be redirected to help seriously ill patients when the incidence of robots is high.
